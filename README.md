# Map Learn

Dev Academy final project. An interactive map where you can learn about different countries in the world

## Post Dev Academy Notes

- In our group we were excited to do a project that involved an interactive map. We had never used SVGs before so we were happy we were able to accomplish this. We had a big focus on planning (as seen by our bootcamp Readme below) and incorporating agile techniques such as stand ups, agile roles, spikes etc.

- There are certain things I would do differently or would like to alter. I would have liked if we had had time to add a zoom function and added more responsiveness. As well, I think there are changes we could make to the styling and colour choices, for example with the colour scheme/contrasts, to make it more accessible for everyone. But at the same time these are helpful reflections I can now keep in mind for future projects as well.

## Dev Academy Aotearoa Final Project ReadMe

## MVP

* Picture of world map & nav bar
* When you hover it highlights the country
* When you click on it it displays the name and info about that country in a large pop up
* Mobile First
* Making site responsive

## Stretch


* Having a button to zoom in on the map
* Having a search function where you can look for a country on the map
* Have an image appear when it's loading info
* Having a mini pop up with basic information. When you click expand it then goes into the larger original pop up
* Having a functional PLAY section with games
		* eg a name of a country pops up and you have to find the one that matches
		* eg a country is highlighted automatically and you need to guess what country it is. Either multi choice or you write it
* Having a database that saves the name and the highscore
* Have a leaderboard page where you can see all the highscores in order

- When I click a country I want it to display country specific data in a pop up

- I would like to be able to play a game involving guessing countries names/locations

- I would like to be able to have a record of my score to compete against other users

## Our team goals


## BEFORE Starting

### Wellbeing:

### How do you know when you are stressed? What might your stress look like to others so they can suggest one of your stress needs?
	
* Issac/Jore/Maxwell, It might be closing off from the group and not interacting
  
* Alvaro Being flustered and expressing that they don’t know what we are supposed to be doing; when our plan isn’t solid enough or clear enough, or we      are not all on the same page
  
* Maxwell Being overly agreeable as it’s easier

### What each team member needs when they’re stressed?

* Isaac - Take a 15 minute break away from  the computer and the team
* Joré - Being able to be in a quiet space, or being left alone with a task
* Maxwell - Being able to have your own space, having a break to listen to music
* Alvaro - Having a group meeting to get on plan, making sure we all have the same plan. Also having a 15 minute break
  
### Expectation setting and agreements (what do we each want out of this time, what hours will we keep, what do we do when conflict arises, how will we communicate, especially what hours work will happen over the weekend)

* 9 to 5 during weekdays
* Saturday - 9  to 5 (flexible 11-4)
* Sunday - optional day. Sweet if anyone takes the whole day to rest. Ok if others still do some work
   
### How will you make decisions together? How will you handle conflict?

* Majority first
* Then look at it objectively
* Then Maxwell as product owner will have a deciding vote if it works 
* If max is unsure than a facilitator
  
### How will you, individually and as a team, get the help you need (both technically and non-technically)?

* Isaac: Speaking to the team first. Then if a tech issue going to a facilitator. Personal issue go to human skills 				facilitator
* Maxwell:  Same as Isaac, but also speaking to other students. With tech issues, googling and watching videos.
* Joré: Same as above
* Alvaro: Same as Isaac.

* Team: Making sure we are open and honest with each other, but utilising the support network in dev(ie facilitators 		when we can’t resolve something.
  
### How will you make sure everyone feels included?

* Vibes watcher
* Making decisions as a group when possible
  
### How will you decide who needs to be present for which conversations

* For changes that could impact others then a group discussion
* Stand ups for everyone
* Deeper discussions about a feature, for example, may not need to have everyone included
* eporting back on a spike may not need everyone

### How will we work (what roles and what agile rituals will we use etc)

* Sprints
* Stand ups
* Spikes -
* 30 minutes meeting each morning
  * What are we doing
  * Whats the goal/sprint
  * General wellbeing checkin
    
### How will you survive (Will you eat together? How will you break the tension? What is your fun times plan?)

* Saturday Lunch
* Making sure to have breaks and time apart
* Games 
  
### What is the timeline before asking for help aka how long will you wait before getting help?

* The time between two stands
* If it’s a smaller piece of code that refuses to work, 15 minutes
  
### MVP

*Completed by Midday Monday


## WHILE & AFTER

### What tech will you be using? Is there anything you need to research? If you’re using our stack, will you use Redux?
	
* React
* Redux (repo will have redux but for MVP not needed)
* Chakra
* Sass / css
* Database (with stretch)
* API or a JSON file
* Framer - provides animations
* SVG - to do the countries in the map
 
### GitFlow. How will you arrange your work?

* Feature branches that we then merge and delete
* Only do pull requests for functional bits of code
* Commit often
  
### Roles. Which will you use? Who will be accountable for which areas?

* Isaac: git-lead
* Alvaro: Vibes
* Maxwell: Project Owner
* Jore:  Scrum Lead
  
### What might a day look like? What agile rituals will happen?

* Daily sprints. But we set individual goals of what we want to have done by lunch and the end of the day
* Organising sprints by priority. If someone finishes their own goals but someone else hasn’t finished theirs then they can then assist the other person    before grabbing a new task
 
### Stand ups - how often?

* 30 min catch up at the start
* Fixed stand ups at 12 and 4. Otherwise we can request a stand up when we need
  
### When during the day will you do the hard tech?

* Depends on the day
  
### Will you go outside as a team?

* Go for a beer, maybe lunch on the weekend
